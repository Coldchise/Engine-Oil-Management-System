This application is designed to monitor and record the fuel consumption of a vesselâ€™s main engine and auxiliary engines, providing accurate reports in line with the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan (SEEMP) requirements. In addition to fuel usage, the app tracks critical engine parameters such as RPM, lube oil pressure, and fresh water temperature, ensuring they remain within the tolerable limits set by the engine manufacturer.

The system enables continuous performance monitoring and generates detailed reports, making it a valuable tool for both onboard crew and technical superintendents. It supports proactive maintenance and decision-making by offering real-time insights into engine performance, contributing to operational efficiency, compliance, and safety.
